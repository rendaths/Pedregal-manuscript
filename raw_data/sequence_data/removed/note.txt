these four samples are not included in the Pedregal analysis but we included them in the run because we wanted to know if they are the same sample. This is mainly because we got a report from a person who is in charge of the sampling collection and his case report has two occurrences in the two dogs he sampled one after the other, both results as rabid dogs. One occurrence was in 2021 and the other in 2023. 
I will send you this metadata further because I do have not that information and is not included in the Pedregal Analysis.
Kind regards

PD. Here are the four samples, as you can see, the numbers are correlatives.
